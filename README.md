### Representing grayscale images using weighted finite automaton
<hr>
This is my thesis for the bachelor's degree. It is a program, which demonstrates a research about how to represent grayscale images using weighted finite automaton. I studied some researches about this topic by Karel Culik, Jarkko Kari and Frank Katritzke.

Here it's an example automaton by Frank Katritzke representing an image.
