# Representing grayscale images using weighted finite automaton

This is my thesis for the bachelor's degree. It is a program, which demonstrates a research about how to represent grayscale images using weighted finite automaton. I studied some researches about this topic by Karel Culik, Jarkko Kari and Frank Katritzke.

There is an example automaton below by Frank Katritzke representing an image.
